# Atlas
any number of people can play atlas with each other with this program

## Prerequisites:
* Java.
* Basic knowledge of country names.
* Java in path

Do not delete the file "all_countries.txt". That would cause the whole program to not work. As the name of the file suggests, It has the name of all countries in it. 
The main file is "Atlas.java".  
Usage:(navigate to the installation folder first) javac Atlas.java
      java Atlas.java
If you have never played Atlas, the rules are simple. Type a country's name. The next player would have to type a country starting with the preceding player's country's last letter. The game would continue till the countries would run out or a person can't think of a country. Have fun!

NOTE ADDED IN MARCH 30 2022:
See now I know how to make the code shorter but I wont because I'm too lazy to change the weird logic. If I change one thing, I'll have to deal with something else. I can suggest some changes to people who might want to edit the code though, don't handle the first letter problem like that, try making it more abstract, that way the code will be super shorter, and the first letter can be literally anything. That's just one of the many changes that'll make this code better and shorter. Tip to Sameer from 2021? Try making your code shorter and faster. Huge lines of code isn't a sign of greatness, stop trying to make the code more complex. Simple and clean code is the best.
