# Atlas
any number of people can play atlas with each other with this program

##Prerequisites:
*Java
*Basic knowledge of country names
*Java in path
Do not delete the file "all_countries.txt". That would cause the whole program to not work. As the name of the file suggests, It has the name of all countries in it. 
The main file is "Atlas.java".  
Usage:(navigate to the installation folder first) javac Atlas.java
      java Atlas.java
If you have never played Atlas, the rules are simple. Type a country's name. The next player would have to type a country starting with the preceding player's country's last letter. The game would continue till the countries would run out or a person can't think of a country. Have fun!
